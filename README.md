# Deepfake Detector ( for Intelligent Model Design Using AI course)
This project is an advanced computer vision framework designed to tackle the growing challenge of synthetic media and facial manipulations. Developed as a centerpiece for the Intelligent Model Design course, this project leverages a high-performance EfficientNet architecture to identify subtle spatial inconsistencies and artifacts that characterize AI-generated deepfakes. By optimizing the detection pipeline for local execution on Apple Silicon using TensorFlow-Metal, the model achieves high-precision results while remaining accessible for real-time forensics. This repository represents a transition from conceptual AI theory to a practical, explainable solution for verifying digital authenticity.
